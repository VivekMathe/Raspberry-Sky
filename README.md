# rsky

Team RaspberrySky's drone code for the 2025-2026 PSU autonomous vehicle capstone



A "libs" folder will need to be created for this code to work. Eigen must then be downloaded from https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main\_Page, and unzipped into libs. After this is done, run CMake to build solution. Set "rsky" as startup project, and then run.
